### Introduction

This project aims to enhance the performance of the Password-Based Key Derivation Function (Pbkdf2) in the .NET runtime environment. We achieve this by employing a combination of OpenSSL(1) hash functions and a refined algorithm that minimizes memory and CPU usage. In this README, we provide a comprehensive guide on how to optimize the performance of Pbkdf2 and present the benchmark results to showcase the improvements achieved.
