### Introduction

This project aims to enhance the performance of the Password-Based Key Derivation Function (Pbkdf2) in the .NET runtime environment. We achieve this by employing a combination of OpenSSL(1) hash functions and a refined algorithm that minimizes memory and CPU usage. In this README, I provide a comprehensive guide on how to optimize the performance of Pbkdf2 and present the benchmark results to showcase the improvements achieved.

### Problem
Consider having an IdentityServer which supports `client credentials` to verify the clients. Either in `authorization-code` or the other OAuth flows (Which in our case, it's not that important)

Verifing the client `password` is a `cpu intensive` task. So if in case of the high throughput there must be a way to have a high perfomant endpoint.

Results till now:
